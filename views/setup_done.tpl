		<h3>Done Initial Configuration!</h3>
		<p>The app has been configured and the configuration file is instanceconfig.py.
		The configuration app, config_app.py, has been renamed to disabled_configurator as a security precaution.
		To re-run this wizard, you must rename it back to config_app.py.</p>
